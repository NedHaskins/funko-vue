			<h2>About This Project</h2>
		</module-header>

		<p>This site runs on the Node.js runtime environment.</p>

		<p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used in the source code.</p>

		<p>
			The project is built from scratch with Vue 3, a JavaScript framework / UI library. It allows for application
			components to be grouped together and partialed out in logical ways, improving developer experience during
			application design, testing, and delivery.
		</p>

		<p>
			The project is a culmination of the work done during the Design for the Web course â€” and it will continue to be
			built out over time!
